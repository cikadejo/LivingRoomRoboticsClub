Task: write a program that uses touch LED to turn green when robot is driving over a line, and to turn off when robot is not driving over a line.


Steps / hints:

1. Add a touch LED to your robot. 
2. Add second color sensor to your robot. Purpose of this color sensor is to detect black lines that are perpendicular to direction of robot's travel.
3. Create a file with your program. Name it either YeOldFaithful.c, or Revolver.c (depending on your team name).
4. Save the file in the folder \LivingRoomRoboticsClub\curriculum\2018-04-01
5. Open the file in RobotC.
6. Make sure that the touch LED and second color sensor are added in "Motor and Sensor Setup" (button in RobotC toolbar).
6. Inside infinite loop, read value detected by the second color sensor. If the value detected by the color sensor is less than 200 
  (this means color sensor sees light color), drive left. Otherwise, stop the robot.

  Hint: you will need an "if statement", which executes code only if certain condition is met.
  In your case, the condition is whether color sensor returns value less than 200.
  If statement should be executed inside the infinite loop that you have added earlier.

	// <condition> below should be true if color sensor sees value less than 200
	if (<condition>)
	{
		// Add code here to drive to the left
	}
	else
	{
		// Add code here to stop the fifth wheel
	}

Hint: value of 200 may or may not be correct. Experiment with other values. 
Try 100, 300, 50, 0, 400, and see what happens.
Which value works well?
