Task: write a program that stops the robot after it crosses three black lines that are perpendicular to direction of robot's travel.


Steps / hints:

1. Start with the file from the previous task.
2. You will need to use a variable to remember number of lines robot crossed. 
   A variable is a named place in computer memory that can store a value so that it can be used later.
3. Before it can be used, a variable needs to be declared first. Declare your variable at the very beginning of your main task.
   Here is how you can declare a variable and set it initial value to zero:

   int countOfLinesCrossed = 0;

4. Each time your program detects that robot crossed a line, increment your variable by 1, like this:

   countOfLinesCrossed = countOfLinesCrossed + 1;

5. Important: variable names are case sensitive. Following two variables are *not* the same:

   countOfLinesCrossed
   countOFLinesCrossed

6. When count of lines crossed reaches 3, exit your program. To exit your infinite loop, you can use break statement.
  
   while(true)
   {
       // Your code goes here
       // Even more code here ...

       // Detect whether it is time to exit infinite loop
       if (<condition>)
       {
           break;
       }
   }
