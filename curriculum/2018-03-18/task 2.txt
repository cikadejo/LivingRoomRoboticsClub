Task: write a program that moves the robot to the left if the color sensor is not on the line at all, 
      and moves the robot to the right if the color sensor is completely on the line.
      The goal is to position the robot exactly on the rigt edge of the line.


Steps / hints:

1. Start with the program from the previous task (described in "task 1.txt").
2. Hint: modify your if statement from previous task in the following way:

	// <condition 1> below should be true if color sensor sees value less than 200
	if (<condition 1>)
	{
		// Add code here to drive to the left
	}
	// <condition 2> below should be true if color sensor sees value greater than 250
	else if (<condition 2>)
	{
		// Add code here to drive to the right
	}
	else
	{
		// Add code here to stop the fifth wheel
	}

3. Values of 200 and 250 may or may not be correct. Experiment with other values.
   What happens if two values are too close together (e.g. 200 and 201)?
   What happens if two values are too far apart (e.g. 200 and 400)?
