Task: write a program that drives the robot to the left until it reaches a black line.


Steps / hints:

1. Add a color sensor to your robot. Purpose of this sensor is to detect black line on the field.
   Make sure that color sensor points towards the floor.
2. Create a file with your program. Name it either YeOldFaithful.c, or Revolver.c (depending on your team name).
3. Save the file in the folder \LivingRoomRoboticsClub\curriculum\2018-03-18
4. Open the file in RobotC.
5. Set up your motors and the color sensor once you create the program file. Push "Motor and Sensor Setup" button in RobotC toolbar.
   Hint: you will need to set up two motors, one for left drive and one for right drive.
6. Important: you need to initialize color sensor at the very beginning of your program.
   Initialize it in grayscale mode, with assist light on. 
   Documentation on how to initialize color sensor:
   http://help.robotc.net/WebHelpVEX/index.htm#Resources/topics/VEX_IQ/ROBOTC/Color_Sensor/setColorMode.htm
7. Add an infinite loop to your program, and make sure it is executed *after* color sensor is initialized.
   Infinite loop looks like this:
	while (true)
	{
		// Add your code here	
	}
9. Inside infinite loop, read value detected by the color sensor. If the value detected by the color sensor is less than 200 
  (this means color sensor sees light color), drive left. Otherwise, stop the robot.

  Hint: you will need an "if statement", which executes code only if certain condition is met.
  In your case, the condition is whether color sensor returns value less than 200.
  If statement should be executed inside the infinite loop that you have added earlier.

	// <condition> below should be true if color sensor sees value less than 200
	if (<condition>)
	{
		// Add code here to drive to the left
	}
	else
	{
		// Add code here to stop the fifth wheel
	}

Hint: value of 200 may or may not be correct. Experiment with other values. 
Try 100, 300, 50, 0, 400, and see what happens.
Which value works well?
