Problem: write a program that drives the robot to release one side of bonus tray.


Steps / hints:

- Create a file with your program. Name it either YeOldFaithful.c, or Revolver.c (depending on your team name).
- Save the file in the folder \LivingRoomRoboticsClub\curriculum\2018-03-11
- Open the file in RobotC.
- Set up your motors once you create the program file. Push "Motor and Sensor Setup" button in RobotC toolbar.
  Hint: you will need to set up two motors, one for left drive and one for right drive

Documentation on how to run motors from your code:

Experiment with various speeds for both motors.
What happens when speeds of motors are of different sign (e.g. one is positive and the other one is negative)?
